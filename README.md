# choo-animals-starter


Heavily annotated version of the choo-animals started
I built most of it locally, isntead of on glitch

A starter app for the `your-first-choo-app` tutorial.

First, remix this Glitch app so you can start editing the code.

Once your new remix is open, select `index.js` in the left hand sidebar to get started.

Make sure to follow the tutorial at [https://handbook.choo.io/your-first-choo-app](https://handbook.choo.io/your-first-choo-app)
